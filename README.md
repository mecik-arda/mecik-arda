# Hi there, I'm Arda Meçik! 👋

### Computer Engineering Student @ Trakya University
I am a dedicated software developer currently pursuing my degree at Trakya University. My journey into the world of programming began in the **9th grade**, and since then, I have been constantly building, debugging, and refining my skills across various layers of the stack.

### About Me
- **Deep Dive:** I have a strong interest in low-level programming, particularly exploring how software interacts with hardware.
- **Lifelong Learner:** Coding since high school has given me a solid foundation, but I'm always looking to master new frameworks and languages.
- **Interests:** When I'm not coding, I enjoy parkour-themed games like Dying Light and the Assassin's Creed series. I'm a massive FM fan. It’s the only game I can play for hours on end without ever getting bored; I love the tactical depth and long-term strategy.
