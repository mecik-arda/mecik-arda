# Hi there, I'm Arda Meçik! 👋

### Computer Engineering Student @ Trakya University
I am a dedicated 20-year-old software developer currently in my 2nd year at Trakya University. My journey into the world of programming began in the **9th grade**, and since then, I have been constantly building, debugging, and refining my skills across various layers of the stack.

### About Me
- **Deep Dive:** I have a strong interest in low-level programming, exploring how software interacts with hardware through C, Assembly, and VHDL.
- **Problem Solver:** I enjoy tackling complex logic; I've even built a custom C-based disassembler to understand system internals.
- **Hustler at Heart:** I take full ownership of my learning process, whether it's analyzing unconventional operating systems like TempleOS or automating workflows.
- **Interests:** When I'm not coding, I'm likely scaling buildings in *Dying Light* or *Assassin's Creed*. I'm also a massive *Football Manager* fan—it's the only game I can play for hours without getting bored.
